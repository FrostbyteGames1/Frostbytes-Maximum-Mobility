# Frostbyte's Maximum Mobility (Fabric)

**Overview:**

This mod adds three new behaviors to Minecraft's player movement system, all of which can be toggled independently using keybinds.

1. Step Up: A less annoying version of auto jump that changes the player's step height from 0.6 blocks to 1.25 blocks.
2. Coyote Time: Allows the player to jump up to 10 ticks (half a second) after falling off of a block, making longer jumps slightly more forgiving.
3. Boat Step Up: Applies Step Up to boats, allowing them to climb up to one block at a time, rather than getting stuck on path blocks.

**Notes:**

- I am not currently planning on adding more content to this mod. However, feel free to suggest new behaviors through GitHub's feature request system, and I may consider adding them.

**FAQs:**

- *Will this be updated to 1.x.x?* - Yes! I plan on updating this mod for as long as I can. Expect to wait a few weeks after major Minecraft updates for an updated version of this mod. There may be longer pauses between minor versions depending on how busy I am.
- *Will you make a Forge version?* - No. I don't make Forge mods, but feel free to make your own (unofficial) port as long as you credit me for any code borrowed from this mod.
- *Can I use this in my mod pack?* - Yes! I made this mod for people to use!
